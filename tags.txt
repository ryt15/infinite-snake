Infinite Snake Tags
-------------------

Annotated git tags


v1.0 Primary. See tags.txt!

This first version can be seen as a boilerplate from which students can
learn some basics. Focus should be on Python, at least v3.8.
See Recommended Actions for snake.py in README.md. Try to implement
some of the improvements or feel free to add your own features.
Avoid checking out later versions until you have tried it yourself!

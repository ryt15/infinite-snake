Infinite Snake Tags
===================

Version documentation by annotated git tags.


v1.0 Primary
============

This first version can be seen as a boilerplate from which students can
learn some basics. Focus should be on Python, at least v3.8.
See Recommended Actions for snake.py in README.md. Try to implement
some of the improvements or feel free to add your own features.
Avoid checking out later versions until you have tried it yourself!


v1.1 MatchCase
==============

In Python version 3.10 we can use match/case that is similar to, but
more powerful than, switch/case in some other languages.

We don't have to end lines with backslash to concatenate strings
split over multiple lines any more. But there are still some limits.
See Help._usage_intromsg for example.

Some other minor fixes:
    FileHeader:
    The file header (still everything is kept in a single file) is
    improved and implements dunder names.

    Hash:
    A variable named "hash" was changed to "hashstr" to avoid clash
    with built-in name.

    Pydoc:
    By adding "if __name__ == '__main__':" at the start of the program,
    we can now generate documentation using pydoc from the terminal:
    $ python3.11 -m pydoc snake
    Without this statement, the snake program will execute instead of
    generating documentation.


v1.2 Underscore
===============
The main theme is to use underscore whereever motivated.

Other updates:
A few more suggestions and typo fixes in README.md.
Global variables renamed: SERVER, LOGFILE, PGR, WORM, CONF.
Logging configuration and error handling.
Formatted print statements using f prefix and {}.
The "hashstr" variable was renamed to "_hash".
